st.write("""The output of thecode  is a count plot (a bar chart) that shows the distribution of tracks across different decades in your dataset.

Why the counts decrease after some decades

There are a few possible reasons:

1. Dataset bias (most common)
The dataset (e.g., Spotify dataset) might contain more recent music and fewer old tracks. Streaming platforms usually prioritize modern music catalogs, so counts in early decades (1950s, 1960s) are often underrepresented.

2. Music industry changes

*   Earlier decades (e.g., 1960s–1980s) had fewer global releases, physical limitations (vinyl, cassettes), and lower documentation.
*   In the 2000s–2010s, the digital era allowed a huge surge in music production, so counts peak.

*   In the 2020s (if included), the data may look smaller simply because the decade isn’t finished yet.

3. Data truncation

*   Some datasets stop at a certain year (e.g., up to 2019), so the last decade might look incomplete.
4. Genre and popularity shifts
*   Certain decades had more popular music production (e.g., 1980s pop, 1990s rock), while others had less mainstream output.""")

st.write("""Each feature represents a musical quality, and the ups/downs reflect changes in music styles, technology, and culture:

1. Acousticness

*   High in earlier decades (folk, jazz, rock with acoustic instruments).
*   Decreases with the rise of electronic & synthesized music in 1980s–2000s.

*   May rise again in 2010s due to indie/folk revival

2. Danceability

*   Lower in old ballads/rock.
*   Rises in disco era (1970s), EDM/hip-hop (1990s–2010s)
*   Flucates depending on popularity of dance-oriented genres

3. Energy
*   Rises with rock, punk, EDM (1980s–2010s).
*   May drop in 2010s–2020s when lo-fi, mellow hip-hop, and chill pop became trendy.

4. Instrumentalness
*   High when instrumental genres (jazz, classical crossovers, progressive rock) were more popular.
*   Drops in modern decades since vocals dominate mainstream music.

5. Liveness

*   Spikes in decades with live-recording styles (1970s rock concerts, MTV Unplugged in 1990s).
*   Lower in studio-polished music (2000s–2010s).

6. Valence(positiveness/happiness)
*   High in disco/pop eras (1970s–1980s).
*   Drops during grunge/alternative rock era(1990s)


*   Mixed trends in 2010s with both upbeat EDM and darker hip-hop/lo-fi.

Summary

1. Shifts in dominant genres (disco → hip-hop → EDM → lo-fi)

2. Cultural changes (happy vs dark music trends)

3. Technological changes (acoustic → electronic → digital production)

4. Dataset bias (some decades better represented than others""")

Summary of the chart
1. The chart shows feature profiles of the 10 most popular genres.
2. Genres that are party-oriented (EDM, dance, pop, reggaeton) tend to score high in energy & danceability, low in acousticness.
3. Genres that are acoustic/folk-based show the opposite: high acousticness, lower energy & danceability.
4. Valence (positiveness) fluctuates: some genres are naturally happier (pop/dance), while others are darker (metal/hip-hop).""")

st.write("""a. What the code does

1. Prepares data

a. Selects only numeric song features (e.g., energy, danceability, loudness, tempo).

b. Drops missing values so the analysis runs smoothly.

2. Standardizes the features

a.Uses StandardScaler so all features are on the same scale (mean = 0, std = 1).

b. Prevents features like loudness (dB) from overpowering smaller-scale features like valence (0–1).

3. Clusters songs with KMeans

a.  the songs into 5 clusters (n_clusters=5), where each cluster contains songs with similar musical attributes.

b. Each song gets a cluster label (0–4).

4. Applies PCA (dimensionality reduction)

a. Reduces all numeric song features to 2 principal components (PC1, PC2).

b. These PCs capture most of the variance in the data, making it easier to visualize.

5. Creates a visualization dataset

a. Builds a DataFrame with:

1. PC1, PC2 → the reduced coordinates for each song.

2. Cluster → the assigned cluster label.

3. Title → the song name.

4. Artist → the artist name.

5. Plots with Plotly

b. An interactive scatter plot is generated:

1. X-axis = PC1

2. Y-axis = PC2

3. Colors = different clusters (0–4).

4. Hover tooltip = shows the song’s title and artist.

b. What the output looks like

A 2D scatter plot where each dot = one song.

Songs are grouped into 5 distinct colored clusters.

Songs in the same cluster are close together in the plot → meaning they share similar musical features.

Hovering over a dot shows which song and artist it is, letting you explore individual tracks.

c. Summary of Output

The code produces an interactive PCA scatter plot of songs, where songs are grouped into 5 clusters based on their audio features. Each cluster likely represents a different style of music (e.g., high-energy dance tracks vs. mellow acoustic songs). The plot allows you to explore these groupings visually and inspect specific songs by hovering.""")
